# expense-access.ts

**Source:** `src/lib/db/expense-access.ts`

## Purpose

Read/write helpers for the `expense` table and its joins to `category`, `tag`, and `expenseTag`. Uses the same `withRetry` + `Result` pattern as `auth-access.ts`.

## Types

### `ExpenseRow`

```ts
interface ExpenseRow {
  id: string
  date: string
  description: string
  categoryName: string
  amountCents: number
  tagNames: string[]
}
```

### `ListExpenseFilters`

```ts
interface ListExpenseFilters {
  from: string
  to: string
}
```

## Exports

### `listExpenses(db, filters): Promise<Result<ExpenseRow[], Error>>`

- Public wrapper: calls `withRetry('listExpenses', () => listExpensesActual(db, filters))`.
- Private `listExpensesActual` joins `expense` -> `category` to fetch the category name, filters by `expense.date BETWEEN filters.from AND filters.to` (inclusive), and sorts by `date DESC`, then `lower(description) ASC` for the case-insensitive tiebreak.
- Hydrates `tagNames` via a single secondary query that joins `expenseTag` -> `tag`, grouped by `expenseId` in a `Map`.
